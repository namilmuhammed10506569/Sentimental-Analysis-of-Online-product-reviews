# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Online-product-reviews


The sentiment analysis is the method of evaluating input information sentiments. This research work is linked to consumer feedback sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis steps have three steps which are pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. In the pre-processing phases, the data set of the product review which is collected from the twitter which processed to remove missing and redundant values. In the second phase, N-gram algorithm will be applied which will extract features of the dataset. In the last phase, classification algorithm which takes input as training and test set. It is analyzed that classification techniques naïve bayes which is proposed in the previous research work has low accuracy. In this research work, novel classification method needs to propose for the sentiment analysis of product reviews. 

* To study and analyze various product review sentiment analysis techniques 
* To implement naïve bayes classification method for the product review sentiment analysis 
* To design hybrid classification method for the product review sentiment analysis 
* Implement hybrid classification method and compare with existing method in terms of accuracy, precision, recall
